# Agile Methodology – From Scratch

## 1. What is Agile?
Agile is a **software development approach** that focuses on:
- Delivering work in **small, usable pieces**
- Getting **frequent feedback**
- Adapting quickly to change

Instead of building everything at once, Agile builds **step by step**.

## 2. Why Agile is Needed
Traditional models (like Waterfall) had problems:
- Late delivery
- Difficult changes
- Customer feedback came too late

Agile solves this by:
- Delivering early and often
- Encouraging collaboration
- Welcoming requirement changes

---

## 3. Agile Manifesto (Core Values)
Agile is based on **4 values**:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan  

👉 Items on the right still matter, but **left items are valued more**.

---

## 4. Agile Principles (Simple Version)
Agile follows these ideas:
- Satisfy the customer through early delivery
- Welcome changing requirements
- Deliver working software frequently
- Business and developers work together daily
- Face-to-face communication is best
- Continuous improvement

## 5. Popular Agile Frameworks
Agile is a mindset. It is implemented using frameworks like:
