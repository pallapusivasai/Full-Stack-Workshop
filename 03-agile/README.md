# Agile Methodology – From Scratch

---

## 1. What is Agile?
Agile is a **software development methodology** that focuses on delivering software in **small, incremental releases** with continuous feedback and improvement.

Agile emphasizes **flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction** over rigid planning.

---

## 2. Why Agile is Needed
Traditional development models like Waterfall faced problems such as:
- Late delivery of software
- High cost of changes
- Limited customer involvement

Agile solves these issues by:
- Delivering software early and frequently
- Encouraging continuous customer collaboration
- Welcoming changing requirements

---

## 3. Agile Manifesto – Core Values
Agile is based on **four core values**:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation  
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
4. Responding to change over following a plan  

While items on the right have value, Agile prioritizes the items on the left.

---

## 4. Agile Principles
Agile follows **12 principles**, including:
- Early and continuous delivery of valuable software
- Welcoming changing requirements
- Frequent delivery of working software
- Close collaboration between business and development teams
- Face-to-face communication
- Continuous attention to technical excellence
- Regular reflection and improvement

---

## 5. Agile Frameworks
Agile is a mindset implemented using different frameworks:

- **Scrum** (most widely used)
- Kanban
- Extreme Programming (XP)
- SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)

Scrum is the most important framework from an interview perspective.

---

## 6. Scrum Overview
Scrum is a lightweight Agile framework used to manage complex projects.

Scrum consists of:
- Roles
- Events (Ceremonies)
- Artifacts

---

## 7. Scrum Roles

### Product Owner
- Represents customer needs
- Manages and prioritizes the Product Backlog
- Defines product requirements

### Scrum Master
- Facilitates Scrum practices
- Removes blockers
- Coaches the team on Agile principles

### Development Team
- Developers, testers, designers
- Self-organizing and cross-functional
- Responsible for delivering the product increment

---

## 8. Scrum Artifacts

### Product Backlog
- Ordered list of all requirements
- Written as user stories
- Owned by the Product Owner

### Sprint Backlog
- Selected items for the current sprint
- Owned by the Development Team

### Increment
- A working version of the product delivered at the end of each sprint

---

## 9. User Story Format
Requirements in Agile are written as user stories:

### 9.1 End-to-End Agile Workflow (How Agile Works in Real Projects)

1. Product Owner gathers requirements from stakeholders.
2. Requirements are written as **User Stories** and added to the Product Backlog.
3. Product Backlog items are prioritized based on business value.
4. During **Sprint Planning**, the team selects stories for the Sprint Backlog.
5. Development and testing happen during the Sprint.
6. Daily Stand-up meetings track progress and blockers.
7. At the end of the Sprint, a **Sprint Review** is conducted to demo the work.
8. A **Sprint Retrospective** is held to improve the process.
9. The cycle repeats with the next sprint until the product is completed.

This continuous cycle ensures faster delivery, better quality, and regular feedback.
---

## 10. Scrum Events (Ceremonies)

### Sprint
- Fixed time-boxed iteration (usually **2 weeks**)
- Goal: deliver a usable product increment

### Sprint Planning
- Decide what work will be done in the sprint
- Define sprint goals

### Daily Stand-up
- 15-minute daily meeting
- Discuss:
  - What was done yesterday
  - What will be done today
  - Any blockers

### Sprint Review
- Demonstration of completed work
- Collect stakeholder feedback

### Sprint Retrospective
- Identify what went well
- Identify what needs improvement
- Plan actions for the next sprint

---

## 11. Definition of Done (DoD)
A checklist to ensure work is complete:
- Code implemented
- Tested
- Reviewed
- Ready for deployment

---

## 12. Agile vs Waterfall

| Waterfall | Agile |
|----------|-------|
| Fixed planning | Adaptive planning |
| Testing at the end | Continuous testing |
| Single release | Frequent releases |
| Limited feedback | Regular feedback |

---

## 13. Benefits of Agile
- Faster delivery of software
- Improved quality
- Better customer satisfaction
- Easy handling of requirement changes
- Increased transparency

---

## 14. Agile Tools
Commonly used Agile tools:
- Jira
- Azure DevOps
- Trello
- Confluence

---

## 15. Interview Quick Answers

- **What is Agile?**  
  Agile is an iterative approach that delivers software in small increments.

- **What is a Sprint?**  
  A fixed time-boxed iteration to deliver working software.

- **Who owns the Product Backlog?**  
  The Product Owner.

## 16. How to Start Agile (Beginner Steps)
1. Learn Agile basics and values
2. Understand Scrum roles and ceremonies
3. Practice writing user stories
4. Use Agile tools like Jira
5. Participate in reviews and retrospectives
6. Improve continuously

---

## 17. Personal Understanding of Agile
Agile is not just a set of processes or meetings; it is a **mindset** that focuses on delivering value continuously. What makes Agile effective is its emphasis on **people, communication, and adaptability** rather than rigid plans.

Agile encourages teams to learn from every sprint through feedback and retrospectives. Clear roles, transparency, and collaboration help teams deliver quality software faster.

Overall, Agile enables teams to respond confidently to change, improve continuously, and build software that truly meets user needs. This makes Agile highly suitable for modern software development environments.
